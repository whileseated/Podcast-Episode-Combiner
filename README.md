# Podcast Episode Combiner

This Python script is designed to download and combine podcast episodes from a specified RSS feed into a single MP3 file. It's suitable for users who are familiar with running Python scripts.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.
- `ffmpeg` must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH. This is crucial for the script to combine audio files.
- `curl` should be installed on your system as it is used for downloading episodes.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository or Download the Script**: Get the script onto your local machine.
2. **Install Required Python Packages**: Ensure `requests` is installed. You can install it using `pip`:

   ```pip install requests```

Run the Script: Use Python to run the script:

Replace script_name.py with the actual name of the script file.

Follow On-screen Prompts: The script will ask for the RSS URL and other inputs as needed.

Output: The final combined MP3 file will be saved in the same directory as the script.

## Notes

This script is intended for combining podcast episodes. It may not work as expected with non-podcast RSS feeds or with files that are not in MP3 format.
